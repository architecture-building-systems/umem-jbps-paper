\section*{Preamble}

{\em latexdiff} is a Perl script, which compares two
latex files and marks up significant differences between them.  Various options are available for visual markup using standard
latex packages such as {\em color.sty}. Changes not directly affecting visible
text, for example in formatting  commands, are still marked in the
latex source.

A rudimentary revision facilility is provided by another Perl script,
{\em latexrevise}, which  accepts or rejects all changes.  Manual editing
of the difference file can be used to override this default behaviour
and accept or reject selected changes only.  

There is no explicit support for annotations as these are trivial to implement.
For example, I include the following command definition in the preamble
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\remark}[1]{{ \bf [ \footnotesize #1 ]}}
\end{verbatim}
and mark up annotations as follows 
\begin{verbatim}
... The roadrunner is the fastest running bird  \remark{Check this 
again with a zoologist!}. The most famous roadrunner ...
\end{verbatim}
Alternatively, instead of a command like \verb#\remark# in the example just given, an
equivalent annotation environment could be defined.
{\em latexrevise} can  remove such comments or
environments from the text body.

%It is planned that the revision capabilities of this system will be
%further expanded, dependent on the amount of feedback received.

On the following pages you find  the {\em man} pages for {\em
  latexdiff} and {\em latexrevise} and a simple example.

\section*{A simple example}

We start with a draft text, \verb|example-draft.tex|, listed here in
full but also included in the distribution (except that the ``verbatim'' environment had
to be renamed to ``Verbatim'' for the listing).

\section*{Introduction}

This is an extremely simple document that showcases some of latexdiff features.
Type
\begin{Verbatim}
latexdiff -t UNDERLINE example-draft.tex example-rev.tex > example-diff.tex
\end{Verbatim}
to create the difference file.  You can inspect this file directly. Then run either 
\begin{Verbatim}
pdflatex example-diff.tex
xpdf example-diff.pdf
\end{Verbatim}
or
\begin{Verbatim}
latex example-diff.tex
dvips -o example-diff.ps example-diff.dvi
gv example-diff.ps
\end{Verbatim}
to display the markup. Of course, instead of \verb|xpdf| you can use 
\verb|okular, evince, acroread| or any other pdf or postscript viewer.

\section*{Another section title}

A paragraph with a line only in the draft document.  More things 
could be said were it not for the constraints of time and space.

More things could be said were it not for the constraints of time and space.

And here is a tipo. 

Here is a table:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Name & Description \\
\hline
Gandalf & Grey \\
Saruman & White
\end{tabular}

And sometimes a whole paragraph gets completely rewritten. In this
case latexdiff marks up the whole paragraph even if some words in it
are identical.
No change, no markup!
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
}

We can now edit
this text as we would do with any other latex file to create
a new revision of the text, \verb|example-rev.tex|.  We should run
\begin{verbatim}
latex example-rev.tex
\end{verbatim}
and look at the resulting \verb|.dvi| file to make sure that all
changes are valid.  An example revision is listed here:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}

\setlength{\topmargin}{-0.2in}
\setlength{\textheight}{9.5in}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{0.0in}

\setlength{\textwidth}{6in}

% Note how in the preamble visual markup is never used (even
% if some preamble might eventually end up as visible text.)

And here is a typo. 

Here is a table:

To compare both revisions, type
\begin{verbatim}
latexdiff -t UNDERLINE example-draft.tex example-rev.tex > example-diff.tex
\end{verbatim}
This results in the following difference file (a few newlines have been 
added in this listing for legibility reasosn):

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A paragraph with a line only in the revised
  document.  }\DIFaddend More things could be said 
were it not for the constraints of time and space.

And here is a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typo}\DIFaddend \DIFdelbegin 
\DIFdel{tipo}\DIFdelend . 

Here is a table:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Name & Description \\
\hline
Gandalf & \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{White }\DIFaddend \DIFdelbegin 
\DIFdel{Grey }\DIFdelend \\
Saruman & \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Evil

And \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{now for something completely different, with not
 a paragraph in sight}\DIFaddend \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sometimes a whole
 paragraph gets completely rewritten. In this
case latexdiff marks up the whole paragraph even if some words in it

\end{document}

Type 
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex example-diff.tex
xpdf example-diff.pdf

to make the markup visible. This is what it looks like:

\vspace{1cm}
\framebox[\textwidth]{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example-diff}}
\vspace{1cm}

If you approve of all the changes in the revision, just continue with 
\verb|example-rev.tex| for the next revision.  If you like to adopt
most but not all changes you can use \verb|latexrevise| in the
following manner.  Simply remove the \verb|\DIFdelbegin| and
\verb|\DIFdelend| tags around the text you would like to keep and
simply remove the text between  \verb|\DIFaddbegin| and
\verb|\DIFaddend| tags, if you do not wish to keep them.  Say you are happy with all proposed changes for the
example above except in
the last paragraph where you prefer the original draft.  You have
to change

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
...
And \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{now for something completely different, with not
 a paragraph in sight}\DIFaddend \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sometimes a whole
 paragraph gets completely rewritten. In this
case latexdiff marks up the whole paragraph even if some words in it
are identical}\DIFdelend .
...
\end{verbatim}
}
into 
{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
...
And \DIFdel{sometimes a whole
 paragraph gets completely rewritten. In this
case latexdiff marks up the whole paragraph even if some words in it
are identical}.
...
\end{verbatim}
}
and run 
\begin{verbatim}
latexrevise -a example-rev.tex > example-final.tex
\end{verbatim}
\verb|example-final.tex| is then almost identical to 
\verb|example-rev.tex| except for the last paragraph.
\end{document}
