The co-simulation of both urban and building-level models leverages the advantages of both platforms. It accounts better for the localized effects of surrounding buildings, geography and climate conditions while maintaining a high-fidelity building systems representation. This paper describes the co-simulation process of the building and urban-scale models of two campuses of higher education buildings in Switzerland. A co-simulation framework is used to execute simulations from both engines concurrently with an exchange of information to leverage the various strengths of each. In the first case study, on-site weather and measured performance data are then compared to the output from two modeling scenarios: building-scale simulation using EnergyPlus and co-simulation of the engines.  The co-simulation process was able to better model realistic conditions for heating, but not cooling in one case study and was able to  highly reduce the discrepancies in prediction between the engines in the other study.
